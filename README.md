# Znak

A minimal, self-hosted markdown editor in the browser. It also has support for $\LaTeX$ and syntax highlighting for code blocks.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/noClaps/znak.git
   cd znak/frontend
   ```

2. Start the server.

   ```sh
   bun install
   bun dev
   ```

3. Build the project.

   ```sh
   bun run build
   ```

   This will build the frontend and place it in `frontend/dist`.
