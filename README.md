# Znak

A minimal, self-hosted markdown editor in the browser. It also has support for $\LaTeX$ and syntax highlighting for code blocks.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/noClaps/znak.git
   cd znak
   ```

2. Start the server.

   ```sh
   bunx serve src/
   ```

3. Write your content. You'll see a preview on the right side. You can then press âŒ˜+S to download the markdown file. **Reloading the page will clear the content, so ensure that you've saved it first**.
